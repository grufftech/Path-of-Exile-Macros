# DUE TO POE STEAM CRASHING ON MY SYSTEM; LOGOUT NO LONGER WORKS WITH STEAM VERSION!!!.

# Installation

- http://ahkscript.org/

- install 32bit version.  

- run POEMacros.ahk while playing POE.  You should see two icons in your taskbar, green H and a white fuzzy thing. 

# Path-of-Exile-Macros

Just a little place for my scripts &amp; resources for Path of Exile.

Cports.exe closes the network traffic of Path of Exile for SUPER FAST alt-f4's. 

## Storage Macros

A & D move left & right while in your stash. 

Shift A & D will move to the start or end of your stash. 

Holding Shift, you can also scroll up & down to move left and right 

## Quick Disconnect

Your tilde key (~) will disconnect POE. 

## Utility Macros

- F2 = Hideout

- F3 = Remaining Monsters

- F4 = itemlevel (largely useless in 2.0+)

- F5 = Party Invite the last person who PM'ed you.

- Shift+F = Searches pwx.me for items like what you have. 

- Shift+T = Shows you exactly what mods you have. 

## Chat Macros

- Alt + 1 tells the pm-er you're in a map. 

- Alt + 2 thanks the pm-er. 

- Alt + 3 tells the pm-er you've sold the item.
